# Workshop: Microsoft LevelUp Workshop

## Welcome

In this Level Up workshop you will work with Microsoft Azure and Calico Cloud to learn how to employ Calico Cloud in order to visualize cluster traffic and pinpoint security vulnerabilities within your Kubernetes AKS cluster.

In today's highly interconnected and digital landscape, ensuring the security of your AKS Kubernetes clusters is an absolute necessity. This workshop provides you with the essential knowledge and skills to strengthen your cluster's defenses thoroughly, guaranteeing the safeguarding of vital workloads and sensitive information. It enables you to tailor security measures to suit your specific needs and keeps you at the forefront of cybersecurity in a swiftly evolving environment.

### Time Requirements

The estimated time to complete this workshop is 60-120 minutes.

### Learning Objectives

- Learn how to set up workload access controls with microsegmentation
- Learn how to use global network policies for namespace (or tenant) isolation)
- Control DNS-based egress access control at the workload level
- Simulate potentially malicious behaviour inside a cluster and identify and observe security events in Calico
- Configure the workload-centric WAF to block simulated attacks
- Integrate Calico Egress Gateway with Azure Firewall

## Workshop Environment Preparation

> :warning: **For this workshop, you are expected to have access to a previously created AKS cluster.**

- Please, follow the instructions on the repository below if you don't have it ready: 

  [Calico Cloud on AKS - Workshop Environment Preparation](https://github.com/tigera-solutions/aks-workshop-prep)

- You can run this workshop from the Azure Cloud Shell, as described in that repository or from a suitably configured local terminal.

- To start your cluster, reload the environment variables create in your Azure Cloud Shell first and then start the cluster. Use the following command:

  ```bash
  source ~/workshopvars.env
  az aks start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTERNAME
  ```

## Modules

This workshop is organized in sequential modules. One module will build up on top of the previous module, so please, follow the order as proposed below.
